<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently a first year full-time CIT student at the downtown BCIT campus and love it!
    I had previously went to JIBC (justice institute of British Columbia) to study law enforcement
    in hopes of becoming a police officer, but after a year of schooling realized it wasn't for me.
    I took a year off school working as a server at Cactus Club North Vancouver to prepare myself
    financially for when I get back to school, decide what I wanted to learn, and travel hangout with
    friends and persue my hobbies. Now enrolled in this course, taking classes like database systems,
    Scripting for IT and fundemental web technologies, I feel a passion to learn that I never felt at JIBC
    and I cant wait to share it all with you!</p>
