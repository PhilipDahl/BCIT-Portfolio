    Today I had my first day at BCIT! I like to consider my self an extrovert, so while most might be
    worried about meeting new people and seeing new faces, I was thrilled! Being that we had all just finished
    summer it was about time I had gotten some routine back into my life and got my brain working again. recently
    I feel like I can actually feel it rotting away.  Summer also helped me acquire a wicked sleep schedule, going to
    bed anywhere between 2-4am and waking up at 1-3pm. So I was happy to see that my first day schedule was short and sweet,
    an orientation at midday for only an hour. Regardless, to practice getting up early since I know every morning for the next
    couple of school years I would be waking up criminally earlier to what im use to I decided to go to bed early (Midnight)
    to wake up just as early (10am).
    I take pride in how I dress and hate not feeling presentable, so after waking up ready to tackle the day I showered
    and got dressed to impress. Then I bussed down to the Seabus from Lonsdale Quay to waterfront and walked to class.
    This was my first time taking transit to my school but certainly not my last, it took me about an hour to get there
    which was helpful to know so I had an idea for when I actually need to wake up early and go I know when to leave.
    <br>    <br>
    I got there about 10 minutes early but almost seemed late the way that everybody was already checked in and seated
    ready for the orientation. I signed in, grabbed my free pen and name tag, then went to find a seat. The only availble
    one was in the very front, so that's where I took refuge.
    <br>    <br>
    The orientation was a nice start to the school year, we got to meet the head of the CIT program Full Stack program
    and other lead roles at our school, they all gave us an idea on what the school year was going to loom like, the
    benefits that we were able to use, and other general information about the school. The lead presenters all seemed
    really cool, down to earth, and chill, and the way that they talked so highly of the course in the buiesness world
    gave me a good feeling, hopefully all the teachers will be like this.
    <br>
    After the presentation we were told how excited they were to have us all in the course then told to prepare for our
    upcoming classes in the week.
    <br>  <br>
    I decided to walk around every inch of the school and see everything the school had to offer. I'm here to give you the
    insider details. The first floor was front desk security, elevators and an escalator to the second floor. The second floor
    was like a common ground, straight out the elevators is the library then a lounge for the students. then all the other floors
    up to 8 are either classrooms or office space. A gym is currently in the making and will hopefully be availble by next year
    so I am quite excited for that.
    <br>
    After my exploration, I transited the same way home, stopped at my gym on the way, did a workout then went home to prepare for
    my first real day at school.
    <br>
    It was a great first day!
