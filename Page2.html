    Today is my first real day of school! my first class ever at BCIT was called Organizational Behaviour! Not only was this my first class of the year, but it was also the first time that my sleep schedule was about to change
    to waking up at 6 am every morning ):.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think it was just out of excitement but for some reason, I was not even that tired.
    I got up with a nice 8 hours of sleep, showered, made my breakfast which was 2 eggs and toast, then went to catch my bus
    which I made just in time. Ever since I got a car I never really imagined myself ever transiting again, and I used to transit
    a lot. But parking downtown is BRUTAL and so is gas, so cheers to saving money and probably the environment I don't know.

    I ended up getting to class 10 minutes early and saw that nearly everybody was already there. Do I need to be coming like
    half an hour before to be considered early??? I don't get it. I found my seat in the back of the class beside the only
    black person there, which funny enough being black is why I sat with him like brothers unite or whatever (nah he's
    a cool guy I'll get to him later). My teacher Ms. Alina introduced herself and then gave us a brief of how the
    term with her was going to go. It seemed all like pretty basic concepts fingers are crossed I'm not jinxing myself. After her
    short but sweet brief on how the term would look she made us do icebreakers with the people around us. The first person
    I talked to was my boy Hanaan (the black guy) I just introduced myself and kinda talked about our lives and then I talked to
    the guy in front of me, Caleb. What drew me to Caleb was his hoodie, it was merch from a game that I have been playing for
    the last 11 years, so as a joke, I said something relating to the game only he would know and somehow it seemed like he
    didn't understand if I was messing with him or not. Which made me over-explain the joke which ruined the joke. After that,
    we just reverted to talking about pleasant life. Before I could to the person on my left the teacher interrupted
    us saying we needed to begin with our lesson. The class was short and simple we started with learning about emotions and how they
    affect us in a work environment. Even though it was really basic stuff I took notes because I might as well get the habit down.
    And that was it! After class, I ended my day with how I always do, bus to my gym where I worked out my legs for the day, went
    home and prepared food for the next day. The only difference is I got on Discord with my main friend group to play video games
    and talk about my first day of school, not for long though because my new goal was to be in bed by midnight, which I succeded at.
