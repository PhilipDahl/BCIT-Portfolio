    While yesterday was my first real day at school, today was my first full day of school.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My schedule is split off in the weeks with every other day being a full day. Meaning Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I only have one class. Tuesday, and Thursday I have two.
    I'd be mad if it was the other way around but 2 classes only two times a week ain't nothing but a thang, no one said it would be
    easy.
    <br/>

    The night before I had packed myself two tuna sandwiches. Currently, in my diet, I am doing something called bulk,
    which is when you purposely eat a lot of everything to gain weight, so that you can use all the excess weight as
    fuel for your body to burn into muscle when you begin to lose weight. I'm trying to gain weight till Christmas to gain 40 pounds in about 4 months, this is not easy but with routine is achievable and I believe in being very
    strict with the health goals I set for myself. Anyway, I grabbed my two sandwiches for lunch at school, showered got dressed
    and caught my bus just on time getting me there 10 minutes early as per usual.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first class to start my day was technical math for IT taught by Ms. Merchant. Math class has always been a tough place for me so I knew that I would need to ask a lot of questions, which I did.
    Today we were learning about the basics of binary, counting in binary, and how/where it's used. It was very interesting, and my teacher
    was good at making sense out of all the questions I asked her which was nice to see. She also briefly talked about how the term
    is going to look for us, just like most teachers on the first day should be doing. We get a decent amount of homework in our class,
    nearly every day a video and quiz to do online along with an assignment and on top of that a worksheet to hand in person. Today though we only needed
    to do the assignment online along with the video.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the start of class I once again sat beside Hanaan and by this point was pretty chill with him, as my first friend at BCIT we helped each other understand the work, asked each other questions, and
    strengthened our bond as a dynamic duo. Friends are important to make in cohort programs like these, they tell you this in the orientation
    but these are people depending on where you go in the business that you might keep connections with for the rest of your lives, outside of
    work or just working in the industry. You will certainly see them every day for the next guaranteed 2 years as long as no one drops out.
    So being kind to everyone and trying to make connections is especially important, as it always is. On that note, i met a new friend named
    Alvin is from Hong Kong, he's not a chipmunk but this rascal is pretty funny, he surprised me. He seemed like the quiet type, but after getting to know him I learned
    that he's quite the opposite always making jokes and acting silly. I simply met him by introducing myself and then talking was easy between
    the two of us. Similarly, I also made another friend named Maxsym from Russia, he prefers to be called Max because he claims that no one can pronounce the accent
    on the name. I'm not sure about that because when I tried I think that I was pretty spot on, he apparently said otherwise but what does he know?
    He was a cool guy as well though, you can tell he's smart and has a good idea of what he's doing also pleasant to have conversations with and funny to hear speak
    because of the accent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By the end of class after getting assigned the homework most of the students found a table outside, about a quarter
    of the class ended up gathering there and we got to meet each other and work on the new homework we had just gotten. I met a couple of other new people,
    one being a friend named Rylan who is from Surrey, he has a background doing coding which I know will soon make him resourceful for help, he is also
    good at math and like everyone else, more than happy to help. I met a couple of other guys briefly but didn't get their names, but I can say
    something different about this school that I am not used to is that everyone is eager to learn and help. I used to be at JIBC and Highschool being
    some how thrown in a crowd that was more there to goof off than anything and just pass which I've never wanted. Having so many smart resources that are so willing
    to help is an amazing feeling and I can't wait to strengthen the bond between everyone. We had a long 2-hour lunch and most of us got our work done by
    the first hour. So afterwards I separated to go sit watch Family Guy and eat my food, and at 2 hours I was once again seated beside Hanaan ready for my next
    class Database Systems taught by Ayesha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Starting the class off was a little confusing because the first thing she did was start her lesson, very fast and abruptly as if we had already
    had her class for the last month, no introduction at all she just started talking fast at that. It was an onslaught of constant information
    being hurled in our direction and we were left trying to understand and take notes with her thick accent, terrible handwriting and fast pace. In our other
    classes, we would get about 2 breaks for about 10 minutes each, but that is not how Ayesha played, she didn't let up for a second. She also wasn't a fan of questions,
    saying that we didn't have enough time for them. Not sure how she expects us to learn then. I won't lie, it was simply brutal and kind of scared me for the next
    classes since now I wasn't sure if I had just gotten lucky with the previous classes and this is what it would be like. I was a little relieved in a sick
    way to see that it wasn't just me who thought this, in fact not a single person in my class could agree that it was nothing less than terrible. Not as in terribly
    hard concept but a terrible teacher. some students have friends in the other cohorts who had her before us and they said the same thing. This means
    that all cohorts now had one thing they could relate to, how bad the Database teacher was. Funny enough I could see that a lot of people were using this as
    icebreakers to meet new people talking about how bad the class is along with the teacher.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After class, I talked with Hanaan Caleb Rylan Maxym and Alvin about the class and they unsurprisingly were extremely concerned about how bad the teaching was. Realistically
    there's not much more we can do right now than thug it out, so we parted ways and I did my after-school routine. At the gym, I worked out my chest and triceps then went home to
    prepare for the next hopefully less challenging day. Before going to bed I hopped on Discord and played video games for a little to chat with my friends.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today was a mediocre day.
